# tinyraycaster-rs

This is my implementation of the [ssloy' tinyraycast](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraycaster/wiki/Part-1:-crude-3D-renderings), a simple raycast generator to render a map like in Doom.

The objective of this project is to get more familiar with rust while working on a fun little project.

Currently on step 9/17
